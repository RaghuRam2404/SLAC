VLC media player (also known as VLC) is a highly portable free and open-source cross-platform media player and streaming media server written by the VideoLAN project.
VLC media player supports many audio and video compression methods and file formats, including DVD-video, video CD and streaming protocols. It is able to stream over computer network and to transcode multimedia files.
The default distribution of VLC includes a large number of free decoding and encoding libraries, avoiding the need for finding/calibrating proprietary plugins. Many of VLC's codecs are provided by the libavcodec library from the FFmpeg project, but it uses mainly its own muxer and demuxers and its own protocols. It also gained distinction as the first player to support playback of encrypted DVDs on Linux and OS X by using the libdvdcss DVD decryption library.The VideoLan project was originally started as an academic project in 1996. VLC used to stand for VideoLAN Client, but since VLC is no longer simply a client, that initialism no longer applies. It was intended to consist of a client and server to stream videos across a campus network. VLC was the client for the VideoLAN project, with VLC standing for VideoLan Client. Originally developed by students at the cole Centrale Paris, it is now developed by contributors worldwide and is coordinated by the VideoLAN non-profit organization.
