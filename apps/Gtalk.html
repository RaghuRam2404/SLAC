Google Talk is an instant messaging service that provides both text and voice communication. The instant messaging service is colloquially known as "gchat" to its users, although Google does not endorse this name.
Google Talk is also the name of the client applications offered by Google to access the service. Google Talk applications are available for Microsoft Windows (XP, Server 2003, Vista, and Windows 7), Android,[not in citation given] Blackberry, and Google Chrome OS operating systems.
Because the Google Talk servers communicate with clients using an open protocol, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP, the service can also be accessed using any other client that supports XMPP. Such clients are available for a number of operating systems not supported by the Google Talk client.
Google Talk uses extensions to XMPP for voice/video signaling and peer-to-peer communication. Google Talk's implementation differs slightly from the draft XMPP Jingle specifications. However, Google Talk is in the process of being updated to be in full compliance with the Jingle specifications.Google has announced that a major goal of the Google Talk service is interoperability. Google Talk uses XMPP to provide real-time extensible messaging and presence events, including offline messaging and voice mailing. Google Talk supports messaging with any service provider that supports the XMPP protocol. This includes Earthlink, Gizmo Project, Tiscali, Netease, Chikka, MediaRing, and, according to Google, "thousands of other ISPs, universities, corporations and individual users.
