nternet Explorer 10 (IE10) is a version of the Internet Explorer web browser released by Microsoft in 2012, and is the default browser in Windows 8.
On 12 April 2011, Microsoft released the first "IE10 Platform Preview", which runs only on Windows 7 and later. While the second platform preview was also available for Windows 7 and later, subsequent platform previews run only on Windows 8. The first preview release came four weeks after the final release of Internet Explorer 9. IE10 reached general availability on 4 September 2012 as a component of Windows Server 2012. A preview of IE10 for Windows 7 was made available for download in November 2012.
IE10 expands on Internet Explorer 9 functionality with regard to CSS3 support, hardware acceleration,and HTML5 support. On Windows 8, it is divided into two editions with different user interfaces: a Metro app that does not support plug-ins and a traditional desktop application that retains plug-in support.On 64-bit computers, the Metro edition runs in 64-bit mode by default.The desktop edition can be run in 64-bit mode by enabling Enhanced Protected Mode.Internet Explorer 10 was first announced on 12 April 2011 at the MIX 11 conference in Las Vegas. In this conference, Microsoft showcased a demo version of Internet Explorer 10 along with a demo version of Windows 8. On the same day, a Platform Preview of Internet Explorer 10 was released on the Microsoft Internet Explorer Test Drive website. It only supports Windows 7; later platform previews only support Windows 8. Internet Explorer 10 Platform Preview 1 supports CSS3 grid layout, CSS3 flexible box layout, CSS3 multi-column layout, CSS3 gradient, and full hardware acceleration.
