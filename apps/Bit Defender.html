Bitdefender is an antivirus software suite developed by Romania-based software company Softwin. It was launched in November 2001, and is in its 15th build version. The 2011 version was launched in August 2010, and it includes several protection and performance enhancements such as Search Advisor and Performance Optimizer. The 2013 version was launched in 25 June 2012.
The Bitdefender products feature antivirus and antispyware, personal firewall, privacy control, user control and backup for corporate and home users. PC Tuneup and Performance Optimizer are available in the Total Security Suite.Bitdefender replaced SOFTWIN's earlier AVX (AntiVirus eXpert) product range. Between 1996 and 2001 AVX became a product available worldwide that offered intelligent updating without user intervention and integrated an internal browser which scanned and monitored all downloaded files. AVX pioneered behavior-based application blocking technology and was also the first antivirus product to include personal firewall features. With the sixth generation of AVX, the product became the first antivirus package to include an application firewall as well as behavior-based blocking. The Bitdefender group spun off from SOFTWIN in 2007.The Bitdefender range includes antivirus products for home users and businesses. Home editions support Microsoft Windows, Symbian OS, Windows Mobile and Mac OS X; business editions support Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X. The current version of the Home/Home Office security suite includes antivirus, anti-spyware, firewall, e-mail spam filtering, backup, tune-up and parental control components. A free basic online scan is offered via the Bitdefender website. The Free version however does require free registration and is valid for 1 year after registration
